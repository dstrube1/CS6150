What can I do to make the world / humanity better?
What would make the world / humanity better?

L10:
Early routing protocols:
DSDV, DSR, AODV, ZRP, TORA, OLSR

Refined implementations:
- RoofNet: ETX metric, SrcRR, ExOR routing protocols (MIT)
- Multiradio multihop routing (MSR)
- TDMA-based MAC (IITB)

L13: some gaps and unclarities, and mispronounced Tagalog, but interesting idea about what can be done to help with political unrest on facebook and twitter - maybe programmed asking questions from Street epistimological root: "are you sure about that? what would convince you otherwise? would you say your speech is hateful and divisive? do you know any other languages?"

CS6150-DUCSS
Computing for Good - Project: P3. DUCSS (Diabetes Ubiquitous Computational Sensing System) 
Objective:
Build an android app (in the future, this feature will be added to an existing android app), which can measure/collect Walking GAIT and perform analysis on that data to classify what kind of problem a person has.

Mentors: 
1- Professor Rosa Arriaga 
	arriaga@cc.gatech.edu
2- Vidhi Talera 

Students:
1- Matthew Days 
2- Chidanand Rajesh Khode 
3- Diya Prodipto Mitra 
4- David Strube

Research Goal: https://gatech.instructure.com/courses/373718/files?preview=47938727

Goals for Spring 2024 include:

Walking data collection and visualization through an android app. 

Add this feature to the existing Diabetic Ulcer Computational Sensing System.
